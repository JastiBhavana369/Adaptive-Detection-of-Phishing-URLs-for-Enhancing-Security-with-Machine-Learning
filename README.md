# Adaptive-Detection-of-Phishing-URLs-for-Enhancing-Security-with-Machine-Learning
 my project builds an adaptive ML-based system to detect phishing URLs using features like domain age, URL length, and patterns. Unlike static methods, it learns from new threats, reduces false positives, and offers real-time protection for users and organizations.
